# Responsive Resume

##Introduction
This is a simple template for you to use to create mobile first responsive resumes.
Feel free to download and use to suit your needs. No attribution required - though I would love to see what you make!
If you have any questions feel free to contact me via twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/philipcdavis">@philipcdavis<a>

##Grid
The 6 column mobile first grid is based off of Dave Rupert's <a href="https://github.com/davatron5000/Foldy960">Foldy960</a> template.
Feel free to customize the image grid, as well as any other section to fit your needs.

##Setup
Setup should be super fast. If it ever takes too long, let me know.

###Step 1: Download and Extract
<a href="https://github.com/philipcdavis/responsive-resume/archive/master.zip">Download</a> and extract the template and put it in whatever folder you want.

###Step 2: Import your images
Your images go into the `img` folder. The dimensions I use are 300x225px but you can make them whatever size you want as long as they are consistent with each other. If you don't want to have a 3 column layout feel free to utilize the grids
Make sure to include an image of yourself. I've named it `profile.jpg` but you can name it anything you like as long as it is updated in the `index.html` file.

###Step 3: Edit the index.html file
* Open up the index.html file in your text editor and begin to replace the text in the welcome section with whatever you want.
* Edit the images by pointing to the names you have designated inside the `img` folder. 
* In the skills section, add your skills in between the `li` tags.
* For the "Experience" section, I try to keep this short just highlighting recent work and linking to your full pdf resume (make sure to replace) and any other important links as well. 
* Update the footer with the correct links. If you have lots of social links to share, I suggest using icons like those from <a href="http://icomoon.io/">IcoMoon</a>

### Optional - Customize the style
If you would like to customize the style you should find it fairly easy to do. The `style.css` file is where you can go to:
* Change the background or header color
* Change the fonts
* Edit the avatar syle
and much more. Feel free to customize and tweak for your own needs.

All the styles should be self explanatory or commented. If you are confused by anything please let me know by opening an <a href="https://github.com/philipcdavis/responsive-resume/issues">issue<a>.
